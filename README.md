# TypeScript Todo App

This simple project comes from this [Mastering TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-typescript/) course.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use TypeScript with the DOM. It uses [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to persist data between page loads.

## This project covers:

- [Non-null assertion](https://learntypescript.dev/07/l2-non-null-assertion-operator)
- [Type Assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html) with the `as` keyword
- Configuring the `tsconfig.json` file to tweak the `target`, `lib`, `include`, and `exclude` properties
- Using the HTML Element types that come bundled with VS Code
- `interface`s and `type`s

## Bonus

I also extended this project to import [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to add some extremely simple base styles. Because it hurt my soul looking at unstyled html.

Given that the focus on this project is working with TypeScript, much app functionality was left on the cutting room floor. This project could also be extended by finishing out the CRUD operations. Specifically, this could be updated to include the ability to Update and Delete todos.
